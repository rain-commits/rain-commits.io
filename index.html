            <h3>Published on 8/5/2025</h3>
            <p>Today was my AP Statistics exam. I felt like the mcq was a little challenging, but the frq was quite easy. I think I got free credits from that exam. <br>
            Next up is precalc and physics, but I think physics will be really hard and bitchy but precalc we got that in the bag haha. That's all for now, <br>
            im out to create a blog.</p>
